When people ask me what I'm reading or when I recommend a book to someone (and forget to send them a link) it's useful to have a common destination where I can send people to grab a link or view a list of books. 

So I thought to myself: Why not make a list that's publicly available so anyone can see what I've read and what I'm planning to read? (basically books I've found or other people recommended to me). I hope you find this list useful, feel free to share it with your friends and family if you believe it will help them.

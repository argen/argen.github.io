I have a complicated relationship with my reading. Over the course of the last years I had years in where I read close to zero books at all. And years in where I read dozens. 

The key for me I guess would be on how "connected" I feel to the topic in the first couple of chapters. I used to read on the iPad (and the iPad Mini) but over the last couple of years I switched to a [Kindle Paperwhite](https://amzn.to/2HnNhRE). 

I find the Kindle to be better than a tablet for reading for different reasons such as: 

* Amazing batter life (several weeks!)
* Less distractions / focus (no notifications from other apps ðŸ˜‰)
* Lightweight and portable (Fits in a pocket)
* Sharp screen (300ppi back-lit e-ink display)
* 4GB of storage (enough for me, *.mobi* files are smallish!)
* Highlighting and Bookmarking accessibly via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)
* Great for travel (carry more than 1 book in the same device/space) 

I tend to do a lot of reading whilst on airplanes, so the combination of all those features are great for me. Also please don't think for a second that I don't read printed books. I have several, but I tend to avoid buying them nowadays since storage or portability is an issue. I also had to give away a lot of them when I moved from Buenos Aires to London, so I tend to favor e-books nowadays.

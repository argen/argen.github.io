I"∫<p>I have a complicated relationship with my reading. Over the course of the last years I had years in where I read close to zero books at all. And years in where I read dozens.</p>

<p>The key for me I guess would be on how ‚Äúconnected‚Äù I feel to the topic in the first couple of chapters. I used to read on the iPad (and the iPad Mini) but over the last couple of years I switched to a <a href="https://amzn.to/2HnNhRE">Kindle Paperwhite</a>.</p>

<p>I find the Kindle to be better than a tablet for reading for different reasons such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazing batter life (several weeks!)</li>
  <li>Less distractions / focus (no notifications from other apps üòâ)</li>
  <li>Lightweight and portable (Fits in a pocket)</li>
  <li>Sharp screen (300ppi back-lit e-ink display)</li>
  <li>4GB of storage (enough for me, <em>.mobi</em> files are smallish!)</li>
  <li>Highlighting and Bookmarking accessibly via <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a></li>
  <li>Great for travel (carry more than 1 book in the same device/space)</li>
</ul>

<p>I tend to do a lot of reading whilst on airplanes, so the combination of all those features are great for me. Also please don‚Äôt think for a second that I don‚Äôt read printed books. I have several, but I tend to avoid buying them nowadays since storage or portability is an issue. I also had to give away a lot of them when I moved from Buenos Aires to London, so I tend to favor e-books nowadays.</p>

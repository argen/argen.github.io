<p>Great article by <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DDH</a> worth reading if you are trying to recruit people thee are some obvious paths that you want to avoid pursuing.</p>

<p>I think the following is true and it‚Äôs one of the better qualities to look out there when evaluating profiles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best are generally the best because they aren‚Äôt typical. Because they came at things from a different angle that gave them a unique perspective, which happens to provide more insights than the widely-distributed approaches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end you want people in a team to have a different skillset and different approach to problem solving. If your team is always filled up with the same type of people you will probably be losing on a huge amount of insight and value out there.</p>

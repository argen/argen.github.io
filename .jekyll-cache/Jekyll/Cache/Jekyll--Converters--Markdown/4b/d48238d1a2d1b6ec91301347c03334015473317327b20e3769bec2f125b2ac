<p>When people ask me what Iâ€™m reading or when I recommend a book to someone (and forget to send them a link) itâ€™s useful to have a common destination where I can send people to grab a link or view a list of books.</p>

<p>So I thought to myself: Why not make a list thatâ€™s publicly available so anyone can see what Iâ€™ve read and what Iâ€™m planning to read? (basically books Iâ€™ve found or other people recommended to me). I hope you find this list useful, feel free to share it with your friends and family if you believe it will help them.</p>

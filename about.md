Hello there! 

![Bruno Belcastro Photo]({{ site.url }}/images/bruno-belcastro-avatar-sq.jpg)

My name is Bruno Belcastro Pinto, I’m currently living in **London, United Kingdom**. 

I’m a **CoFounder** at [Pixel2HTML](http://pixel2html.com) where we help people with their front-end coding needs. Previously I worked at Edelman doing digital communications for clients like Starbucks, Samsung and Diageo. 

I enjoy doing a lot of things, some of them are: travelling, taking photographs with my cameras, watching movies, discovering new music, being a coffee nerd and reading great books. 

I have a list of [places I’ve visited and others I wanna go here](/travel),I think that travelling is a really good thing for doing a bucket list.

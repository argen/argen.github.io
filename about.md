Hello there! 

![Bruno Belcastro Photo]({{ site.url }}/images/bruno-belcastro-avatar-sq.jpg)

My name is Bruno Belcastro Pinto, I’m currently living in **London, United Kingdom**.

I recently left a company that I co-founded called "Pixel2HTML", I'm now taking some time off and focusing on finding what's next for me. You can find more about my career on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobelcastro/).

I enjoy doing a lot of things, some of them are: traveling, taking photographs with my cameras, watching movies, discovering new music, being a coffee nerd and reading great books. 

I have a list of [places I’ve visited and others I wanna go here]({{ site.url }}/travel).
